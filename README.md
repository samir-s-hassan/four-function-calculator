# Simple Calculator

Simple Calculator is an app that mimics a basic calculator. Though, instead of doing the arithmetic directly, we have to push each number we use in our arithmetic and then do the final operation at the end. E.g. if we want to do 32 + 8, we would push 32, push 8, and then press the addition button.
